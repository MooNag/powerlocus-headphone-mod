# powerlocus-headphone-mod

![[finished_product.jpg]]

This is a 3d printed mod for the powerlocus P2 bluetooth headphones to make them sound better (more open and less bass) and more comfortable. I do not recommend purchasing these headphones to do this mod.

## Required tools
- 3D Printer 200x200x50mm (x, y, z)
- Small screwdriver
- Things to take headphones apart
- Soldering Iron (optional, but helps with disassembly)

## Limitations
- No hole for microphone
- Buttons are closed off except for the power switch

## Print parts
Print the stl parts in the stl folder. They can be printed out of any material, but headband might be tighter or looser with certain materials. I used PETG.

## Disassembly
1. Disassemble headphone. You will need to diassemble the headphones but keep the 10 screws, plate that the speakers are mounted to, the wiring, and ear-pads.  I found that de-soldering the battery and left speaker from the mainboard make things easier.
2. Keep the adhesive on the battery or have vhb tape available!
3. Remove circled pegs because they interfere with the case.

## Assembly
1. Re-solder wires if you de-soldered them. Make sure that the strain relief loops are still there. They are important!
2. Screw PCB to right plate using the extra 2 screws from the front. This will secure the pcb.![[images/screw_holes.jpg]]
3. Take the right plate, and headphone cup and 4 screws. Line up the cup with the plate, the speaker should face out. Then ensure that the wire is inside the hole on the top so it does not get pinched. Check again for strain relief. Take the 4 screws and evenly tighten them, a few turns at a time each round robin style. Ensure the ports line up. The frame may snap into place. The screws should bottom out.
4. For the left ear cup follow the same process, but first insert the battery into the plastic piece horizontally near where the power switch is on the right side.
5. Insert the headband on each cup, it should be a friction fit (can be glued into place).
